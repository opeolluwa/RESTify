# Introduction

[RESTify!](https://github.com/restify) is server application generator written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework, to help developers to quickly scaffold  RESTful APIs that can be consumed in web, desktop or mobile application interfaces
The project was created with a developer portfolio in mind, but can be put to good use with minor configuration.

Each page generated by VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, Vue takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.
